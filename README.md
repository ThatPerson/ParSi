Particle Simulator

ParSi is a particle simulator which can be used in a (pretty shocking) interactive mode (not recommended), or as a library. It generates CSV files and table files with data about particle movements as defined by you.
It currently supports the following:
* persistant speed.
* curved paths (speed and force are different angles)
* force balancing
* resolving a force into x and y
* resolving x and y into a force
* collision detection
* gravity

This all works in a 2D plane
