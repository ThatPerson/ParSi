Particle Simulator

Recently I was sat in a Mechanics lesson (M1 of the A Level course in Mathematics) and I was thinking of how easy it would be to detect collisions between two particles. I decided it would be a good idea to do this, so I have started this to write some code to do this.
By default, it will check for collisions between two particles given a velocity and angle of attack of each of them, and work out how far on the X axis they need to be apart in order to collide.
