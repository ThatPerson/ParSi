Particle Simulator

ParSi is a particle simulator which can be used in a (pretty shocking) interactive mode (not recommended), or as a library. It generates CSV files and table files with data about particle movements as defined by you.
It currently supports the following:
* persistant speed.
* curved paths (speed and force are different angles)
* force balancing
* resolving a force into x and y
* resolving x and y into a force
* collision detection

In a upcoming version in the gravity branch I have added gravity support. This allows you to have true to life orbits, etc.

This all works in a 2D plane
